# Project Context

This document is advisory orientation. `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.json`, the
machine module registry, and the execution roadmap remain authoritative.

## Current bounded context

Shift Operations Workspace is a modular operations application organized
around shift records, messages, events, tasks, customer requests, incidents,
handovers, reports, approvals, corrections, and audit evidence. The module
registry distinguishes real runtime behavior from partial, contract-only, and
stub surfaces; those labels must not be rounded up into production readiness.

Phase 1 is complete under its reviewed local/disposable infrastructure
boundary. Phase 2 is closed bounded for the reviewed start-to-freeze lineage.
The Project Operations Skill is also closed bounded. The Project Knowledge
Pack is the current governed tranche, while Refinery, retrieval-ready
contracts, governed retrieval, RAG, and learning runtime remain later work in
the recorded business sequence.

Plans state intent. Implementation status, source, tests, and independent
review evidence determine implemented truth. A future reader must re-open the
canonical files instead of treating this summary as fresh continuity.
